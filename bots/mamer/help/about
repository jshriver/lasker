 NOTE: This file dates back to 1996, and some of the information in it
       is no longer accurate. However, it has been preserved because it
       contains interesting historical information.

     This program is an automated Tournament Direct for use with online
 Chess servers mainly FICS.  If it is used with anything other than    
 FICS at this time it will crash with out question.  It is programmed  
 to respond to the parsing of FICS text only.  Fred Baumgarten         
 originally wrote this code because there was a need and Chevier Joel  
 the creator of Tomato would not share the code.  Fred gave me the code
 in mid 1995 with the stipulation I not release it to anyone.  I       
 have modified and (I hope) improved mame (now mamer).
     Jean (current programmer of Tomato) and I are working very
 closely on developing similar features and improving both tournament
 directors.  Our current project is to create a rating system that will
 be used by both Mamer and Tomato.
     
     Mamer stands for "manage me". Plus the -r- for the
 differentiation between mame (Fred's) code and mamer (mlong's) code.
     Fred's words follow: The intention to write this tournament director
 program came out of the need to have such a program. Tomato - used at
 FICS and written by darkside was not released to the public. Darkside
 even did not want to accept a non disclosure agreement - so I decided
 to write such a program myself. The program is written in C and will
 support a bunch of new features soon. It is beta state since Version
 0.5 but there _are_ bugs. 
 Fred Baumgarten <dc6iq@insl1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>. Have fun !!!

 Mamer is maintained and coded here on FICS by mlong.  PLEASE! FOR BUGS
 PERTAINING TO MAMER TALK TO mlong.
