manager_level

Here is a list of all of mamer's manager levels and their functions.  For a
list of all mamer managers and their levels, use mamer's "listmanagers"
command.

Level 0  : All non-managers are level 0.

Level 5  : Mamer managers who cannot use mamer's manager commands.  This level
           is reserved for the rare case when a manager's manager ablities are
           suspended.

Level 10 : This is an introductory manager level.  Enough manager commands to
           be able to run a tourney are available, and nothing more.

Level 25 : This is the standard manager level.  The ability to add and remove
           chaos points, keep tourneys in mamer's list for longer than two
           hours, and other minor perks are now available.

Level 50 : Managers at this level are co-mamer Vice Presidents.  Additional
           abilites include the ability to shut down mamer and add players to 
           a tourney manually.  Level 50 managers can also modify the manager
           level of managers below level 50, send a message to all mamer 
           managers, and modify some parts of mamer's player database, but
           these commands are usually used by only the mamer COO.  Additional
           responsibilities include keeping up to date with mamer activities,
           consulting with the mamer COO when decisions need to be made, and
           assisting less experienced managers.

Level 75 : The manager at this level is mamer's Chief Operating Officer.  The
           COO handles day to day operations of mamer.  These include new
           manager applications, chaos point appeals, periodic review of the 
           manager staff, keeping the manager staff updated, and basically all
           non-programming mamer issues.

Level 100: This level is reserved for mamer's programmer(mlong).
