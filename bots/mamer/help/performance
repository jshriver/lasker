performance

mamer's "who"(also known as "listplayers") command lists performance ratings
for the players in the tourney.  A performance rating is what the player's 
USCF(several other organizations use the same formula) rating would be if this
tourney was the player's first tourney.  Here is the formula.

         Perf. Rating = Avg. opp. rating + 400 * ((wins-losses)/rounds)

Your performance rating is for the current tourney only.
