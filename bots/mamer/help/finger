finger

Alias: fi

Usage: finger <optional handle>

Use the "finger" command to find out a player's mamer statistics.  If you do
not specify the handle, you will see your own statistics.  Here is a sample 
"finger":

:toddmf's Stats:
:
:Name               Tnys   W    L   D  1st 2nd 3rd Chaos Rating
:----------------- ----- ---- ---- --- --- --- --- ----- ------
:toddmf              751 1894  767 133 355 219   0     0   1.41

:Manager Level:  75

"Name" is the handle of the player you are fingering.
"Tnys" is the number of tourneys he/she has played in.
"W" is the number of games he/she has won in tourneys.
"L" is the number of games he/she has lost in tourneys.
"D" is the number of games he/she has drawn in tourneys.
"1st" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for first place.
"2nd" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for second place.
"3rd" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for first place.
"Chaos" is the number of Chaos Points he/she has.
"Rating" is the player's mamer rating.
"Manager Level" is only displayed for mamer managers.


NOTE: "3rd"s have been recorded for a much shorter time than "1st"s and 
      "2nd"s.  Thus, many players have finished in 3rd more than the amount 
      of times indicated.
