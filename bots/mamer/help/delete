delete

Alias: del

Usage: delete <tourney number>

Use the "delete" command to delete the specified tourney.  The most common
usage of this is to delete a tourney in which there are not enough players to
close and start.  Mamer deletes tourneys that are not "kept" two hours after
their completion.  Please do not delete the tourneys before then, as many 
users view the standings of recent tourneys.
