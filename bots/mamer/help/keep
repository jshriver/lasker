keep

Alias: k

Usage: keep <tourney number> <boolean>

This command is used to edit the "keep" status of a tourney.  If the keep
status is true, mamer will not automatically delete the tourney.  If it is
false, mamer will automatically delete the tourney two hours after its
completion.  "keep # 1" or "keep # y"(y is short for yes) will set the keep
status to true. Using anything else but 1 or y will set it to false.  This
command is most commonly used to save a scheduled tourney or a tourney with
bugs so that it can be examined later.
