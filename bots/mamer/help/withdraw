withdraw

Alias: with

Usage: withdraw <tourney number>

Use this command to withdraw from(in other words, leave) a tourney.  If the
tourney has not started yet, you may withdraw without penalty.  However, if 
you leave a tourney in progress, you will gain chaos points equal to 10 times 
the number of rounds you miss.  If you were playing in a round robin tourney, 
the results of your games will all be set to 0-0.  If you were playing in a 
swiss, the results of your completed games will stand, but you will lose
remaining games by forfeit.
