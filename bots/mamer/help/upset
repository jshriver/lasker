upset

mamer's "who"(also known as "listplayers") command lists upset points for each
player in the tourney.  Upset points are gained for beating or drawing higher
rated players.  If you beat a higher rated player, you gain the difference in
ratings in upset points.  If you draw a higher rated player, you gain half the
difference(rounded down) in upset points.  For example, a 1600 who beats a 
2001 would gain 401 upset points.  If the game had ended in a draw, the 1600
would have gained 200 upset points.  Upset points do not carry from tourney to
tourney.
