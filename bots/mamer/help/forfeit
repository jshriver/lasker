forfeit

Alias: fo

Usage: forfeit <handle> <tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 10 or higher)

The "forfeit" command forfeits the specified handle from the specified 
tourney. If a player is forfeited from an open tourney, he is removed from the
tourney with no penalty.  If the tourney is in progress when the player is
forfeited, the player will gain chaos points equal to 10 times the number of 
rounds he/she missed.  Please remove these chaos points if you feel they are 
unwarranted. If the tourney is in progress and it is a round robin, the
results of the player's games are all set to 0-0.  If the tourney is in
progress and it is a swiss, the player's results for completed games stand, 
but he/she loses all uncompleted games by forfeit.
