addtotourney

Alias: att

Usage: addtotourney <handle> <tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level of 50 or higher)

This command forces <handle> to join the specified tourney number. Its main
usage is to quickly create a test tourney, but it can also be used to get a
player new to mamer in to a tourney that is about to start when he/she cannot
figure out how to join.  If you use this command in this fashion, please
inform the player how to join future tourneys so that the player does not rely
on managers to add him/her to the tourney.
