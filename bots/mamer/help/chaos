chaos

Chaos points are gained for disrupting a tourney and lost when you complete a
tourney successfully.  If you are forfeited or withdraw from a tourney in
progress, you will gain 10 chaos points for every game you miss.  Other
tourney disruptions, including(but not limited to) profanity, playing
non-tourney games, and misuse of the the tourney channel(telling channel 49 
"hi mamer" repeatedly, for example) will usually be rewarded with 10 to 20
chaos points at the manager's discretion.  If you are given chaos points by
the manager, you will be sent a message explaining why you gained the points.
If you feel you have been unfairly given chaos points, contact mamer's Chief 
Operating Officer(currently toddmf).  If you complete a tourney without 
withdrawing or being forfeited, you will lose one chaos point per round 
played.  If you reach 100 chaos points, mamer will censor you, preventing you
from playing in mamer tournaments.  You can check how many chaos points you
have by using mamer's "finger" command(type "mam finger").
