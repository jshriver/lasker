---------------------
A brief credits file.  The first part are people I'd like to thank,
and the second part are messages that have to be placed here
for legal reasons.

I would like to thank Michael Moore for starting the
chess server many moons ago.  I don't know where he
is today, but his legacy is all of these chess servers
(chessd, FICS, ICC, chess.net)

Thanks to Richard Nash.  Mr. Nash wrote
most of my original code, and without him who knows
where the state of Internet Chess would be.

I'd also like to thank the people who contributed to the ICS
code that Nash authored.  This includes all developers from the
years that Nash's code has been around.

I'll specifically thank the FICS contributors.  Without FICS, 
this project wouldn't exist today.  Much thanks to David Flynn (DAV).
He still doesn't support chessd, but perhaps one day he will.

Poul-Henning Kamp and Mark Murray.  Their code developed for FreeBSD
was used in the password handling routines in chessd.  I owe you a beer, phk.

And of the chessd project:

Chaz Randles - Emotional support, countless design discussions, consulting.

Hristo Doichev - Letting me know that I was doing the right thing with going
		forward with chessd.  Various programming work.

Gian-Carlo Pascutto - Being with me the entire way, both mentally and
		with help with testing and programming.

Vance Ray -  Letting me know how I could use a real database server for
		managing the players, games, etc.  This is unimplemented,
		but I'm looking into writing it myself (or, preferred) having
		someone implement this.

Brent D. Rockwood - Contributing the chessd logo.  He also may takeover as
			the webmaster in the future :)  (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge)


Thanks to everyone who help made chessd possible!
