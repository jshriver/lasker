Hello Chess Server Administrators,

  I, nash@nomos.com, am getting dozens of emails everyday inquiring about  
chess servers. I would like to stop this. Could you please remove any  
reference to nash@nomos.com or nash@visus.com from the help files associated  
with FICS. This is in both your running systems and versions of the code that  
is being passed around or placed in ftp'able directories.

  There are also references to ftp.visus.com in help files. These should also  
be removed.

  Could you also pass this message along to anybody that you know who may  
have a copy of FICS but who I've missed on my search for FICS's.

  That said, thanks to all of you for taking the FICS code and making it a  
success! I'm so happy that my work to keep chess servers available and free  
did not fail.

Rich
